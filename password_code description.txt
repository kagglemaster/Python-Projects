This Python code generates a random password of a specified length using a predefined set of characters. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. `import random`: This imports the random module in Python, which provides functions for generating random numbers, selecting random elements from lists, and shuffling sequences.

2. `chars`: This is a list that contains all the characters from which the password will be constructed. It includes lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits (0-9), and special characters like punctuation symbols.

3. `length = int(input("Enter the length of password: "))`: This line prompts the user to enter the desired length of the password. The `input()` function takes user input as a string, which is then converted to an integer using `int()` and stored in the variable `length`.

4. `if length <= 20:`: This `if` statement checks if the length of the password entered by the user is 20 characters or less.

5. `for i in range(1, length+1):`: This `for` loop iterates from 1 to the specified length of the password (inclusive).

6. `print(random.choice(chars), end="")`: Inside the loop, `random.choice(chars)` is used to select a random character from the `chars` list, and `print()` is used to display the selected character on the screen. The `end=""` argument is used to prevent the `print()` function from adding a newline character after each character, so that the characters are printed on the same line.

7. `else:`: If the length of the password entered by the user is greater than 20 characters, this block of code is executed.

8. `print("Max length is of 20 characters.")`: This line prints a message indicating that the maximum length of the password is 20 characters.

Overall, this code generates a random password of the specified length using a set of predefined characters and ensures that the length of the password does not exceed 20 characters.
